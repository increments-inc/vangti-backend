## notes from developer
#### credit mode


    after each txn, provider owes platform 10% credit
    after each txn, platform gets from provider 10% credit
    
    lets see
    we have digital wallet after each txn
    which is basically useless

    model needed: (the total balance need to be zero)
    sheet that has what provider has earned per txn, platform fee (DIGITAL WALLET in transaction app)
    sheet that has what seeker has transacted with provider
    sheet that has what seeker has earned with ads

    sheet that has what the comapny earns from provider
        upto date what the company earned
        
    there need to be 
        ledger
